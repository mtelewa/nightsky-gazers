                        <h3>Carl Sagan</h3>
                        <p> Astronomer, cosmologist, author, and science communicator who played a pivotal role in popularizing science and
                            inspiring generations with his passion for the cosmos. Beyond his scientific contributions, Sagan was a gifted communicator who made complex scientific 
                            concepts accessible to the general public. He authored more than 20 books, including the best-selling "Cosmos," which accompanied the highly acclaimed
                            television series of the same name.

                        <h3>Brian Cox</h3>
                        <p> Renowned physicist, cosmologist, and science communicator known for his ability to make complex scientific concepts accessible and engaging to the public.
                            He conducted research at prestigious institutions such as CERN, where he worked on the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider.
                            In addition to his work in academia, Brian Cox is perhaps best known for his television appearances and documentaries.

                        <h3>Edwin Hubbble</h3>
                        <p> Astronomer whose groundbreaking discoveries revolutionized our understanding of the universe and forever changed the field of astronomy.
                        Hubble's most significant contribution to astronomy was the groundbreaking discovery that the universe is expanding. 
                        By observing distant galaxies, Hubble found that galaxies are moving
                        away from each other at velocities proportional to their distance. This discovery, known as Hubble's Law, provided compelling evidence for the expanding
                        universe and laid the groundwork for the Big Bang theory.
