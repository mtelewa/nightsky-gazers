[View the deployed project here](https://mtelewa.github.io/nightsky-gazers/gear.html)

STARGAZERS is a website for amateur and professional astronomers to get to know top stargazing locations and a basic understanding of the gear involved and most importantly to meet up. The website thrives on getting the astronomer community closer on a global scale.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The colors chosen were based on the background image of a stary night sky. The colors shall give the user a feeling of a calm night in the desert or from a mountain top - just like how it would be when star gazing. The color palette used is inspired by
<br>
<br>
<img src="documentation/design/color-palette.png" alt="Color Palette" width="50%">

Aside from the dark blue background image, I have used mainly 

* `rgba(191,191,191,0.4)` for `div` boxes border and shadow
* `rgba(7, 3, 51, 0.6)` for the footer background
* `color:rgb(253, 165, 0)` for hover effects
* `#ffffff` for the font to provide contrast against the background
